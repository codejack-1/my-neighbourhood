                                                    procedures to provide painless dental treatment to the patient.

                                                    that children are comfortable and have a pleasant experience on

                                                    consultation for your child.</p>

                                                <p>We recommend that a child goes to the dentist by age 1 or within
                                                    six months after the first tooth erupts. Primary teeth typically
                                                    begin growing around 6 months of age. The sooner children begin
                                                    getting regular dental checkups, the healthier their mouths will
                                                    stay throughout their lives. Early checkups help prevent
                                                    cavities and tooth decay, which can lead to pain, trouble
                                                    concentrating, and other medical issues.</p>

                                                <p>Dentures are removable appliances that can replace missing teeth
                                                    and help restore your smile. If youâ€™ve lost all of your natural
                                                    teeth or few of them, whether from gum disease, tooth decay, or
                                                    injury, replacing missing teeth will benefit your appearance and
                                                    your health. Thatâ€™s because dentures make it easier to eat and
                                                    speak better than you could without teethâ€”things that people
                                                    often take for granted.</p>

                                                <p>We offer different types of dentures ranging from flexible
                                                    snap-on dentures to partial dentures. These dentures offer
                                                    maximum comfort and help in giving shape to the face and cheek
                                                    muscles that sag due to missing teeth. You will see that
                                                    dentures make you look younger and make your excess wrinkles
                                                    disappear.

                                    that it's a risky procedure as it's very deep.
                                    You were so confident about the procedure that I felt better just after talking
